      Outside of work and studies, I enjoy playing video games. I'm also a passionate sports enthusiast with a strong background in athletics, especially voleyball. Lastly, my advanced English skills have been invaluable for traveling, allowing me to explore diverse places and immerse myself in different cultures.
